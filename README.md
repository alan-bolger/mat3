# Mat3

Mat3 is a simple and lightweight C++ header-only 3D matrix library.

## Getting Started

Place the Mat3.h file into the folder where your header files reside. Now you can include the library
(`#include "Mat3.h"`) wherever you need to use it.

This library requires Vec3.h, which can be obtained [here](https://github.com/alan-bolger/vec3 "Get Vec3.h").
